# Alien Invasion game
Alien Invasion game using Python and IntelliJ in IDE

# Description
The game Alien Invasion, where the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left only using the arrow keys and shoot the bullets using the spacebar. When the player clicks the "Play" button, a fleet of aliens fills in the screen and start moving in the direction right and left and down a little by little. The player shoots and destroy the aliens. If the player shoots all aliens, a new fleet appear again in next level and they moves a little faster than before. So each level the player beat, a fleet of aliens will gain faster and more challenge. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player will lose a ship as live. If the player loses three lives, the game is over.
